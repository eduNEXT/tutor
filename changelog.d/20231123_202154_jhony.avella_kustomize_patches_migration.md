- ðŸ’¥[Improvement] Replacing "patchesStrategicMerge" key with "patches" key in the main Kustomization file. [patchesStrategicMerge](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patchesstrategicmerge/) is going to be deprecated in future releases of the Kustomization API. It is replaced by the [patches](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patches/) key which is more powerful and allows defining different patch types. This has the following consequences:
    - The patch "kustomization-patches-strategic-merge" was renamed to "kustomization-patches"
    - Extra Kustomization patches added via the "kustomization-patches" Tutor patch must respect the format specified [here](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patches/). It implies moving old "patchesStrategicMerge" extra patches to the "patches" format.
